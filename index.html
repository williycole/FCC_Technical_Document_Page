                <li>This Document will give you the basics of C programming so you can write your own C programns.
                </li>
                <li>A lot of Modern Programming languages are actually based off of C.</li>
                <li>C is one of the oldest programing languages around.</li>
                <li>C Programming can be used to do all sorts of things, graphics, game
                    programming, graphics, computer networking, and many more.</li>
                <li> You will need to compile your C programs for them to work properly. I prefer using the Codeblocks
                    IDE as that is what I learned on, it is very user friendly.</li>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
            <header>Hello World</header>
            <p>Firstly load up you text editor/compiler and lets make sure everything is working by typing in and
                compiling the code below.If everything is working fine you should be able to print out "Hello world!" to
                the terminal.
            </p>
            <code>
 int main() {
     printf("Hello world!\n");
     return 0;
   }
            </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>Here we use the printf function just to print our story, just like in the above example.</p>
            <p>This will print to the Terminal <span class="termText">There once was a young camper that was selft
                    taught!</span> However the \n will
                bring you to the next line and is not printed.
            </p>
            <code>
 int main(){ 
     printf("There once was a young camper that was selft taught!\n")
     return 0;
   }
            </code>
            <p>In the below code we see <span class="termText"> 3 strings</span> contained in the "" quotation
                marks,</span>
                you also see <span class="termText">\n </span>which brings you
                to the next line, a semi colon <span class="termText">; at the end of each printf();</span>, and <span
                    class="termText">return</span> which allows you to end and return the code.
            </p>
            <code>
 int main() { 
     printf("Hello world!\n");
     printf("There once was a young camper that was selft taught!\n");
     printf("The camper's name was Jim.\n");
     printf("He was 27 years old and went to school for Geology.");
     return 0;
   }
            </code>
            <p>Below <span class="termText">char</span> and <span class="termText">int</span> are used, char deals
                with <span class="termText">letters</span>, where as int is for dealing with <span
                    class="termText">numbers</span>.
            <p>
                Both char and int are used to create and define
                the variable names,<span class="termText">%s</span> is used as a place holder for
                <span class="termText">characterName</span>, and <span class="termText">%d</span> is used as a
                placeholder for
                <span class="termText">characterAge</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This way all I have to do is change camper or 27 to something else and it will update when it prints
                where %s and %d. Data Types will be covered more in the next section.
            </p>
            <code>
 int main(){
     char characterName[] = 'camper';
     int characterAge = 27;
     printf("There once was a man named %s\n", characterName);
     printf("he was %d years old.\n", characterAge);
     return 0;

                Format specifier basics: tells the printf you want to print data that is not a character
                %d means you want to print a number
                Here text and a numbers printed together various ways, one of which they are printed by printed by
                calling them from defined variables above.

        %n	prints nothing
        %d	a decimal integer (assumes base 10)
        %i	a decimal integer (detects the base automatically)
        %o	an octal (base 8) integer
        %x	a hexadecimal (base 16) integer

                certain values.
                This is shown below with break and case, case is our parameters that grade is checked with, the break
                says ok break out and check the next one
